.SH DESCRIPTION
SSKit is made up of several small programs that work together,
functioning as one.
.SS Currently main tools
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[I]sskd\f[R]: Snapshot tools daemon.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[I]ssmk\f[R]: For making snapshots.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[I]sscl\f[R]: For cleaning snapshots.
.SS Additional tools
Additionally, it also integrates the following tools:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[I]ssct\f[R]: Shows creation and changed time a snapshot.
.SS Not implemented yet tools
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[I]ssst\f[R]: Shows some statics of interest.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[I]ssgui\f[R]: Graphic user interface.
.SS Basic operation
Edit \f[CR]/etc/sstab\f[R] at your preferences and then start and enable
the provided service:
.PP
For systemd: \f[CR]sskd.service\f[R].
.PP
For dinit: sskd
.PP
On startup \f[B]sskd\f[R] will load \f[CR]/etc/sstab\f[R] (see sstab(5))
into memory and periodically creates or deletes snapshots in the
specified \f[I]pool\f[R] directory.
.SS \f[CR]/etc/sstab\f[R]
A simple table, named \f[CR]/etc/sstab\f[R] is provided as configuration
file.
.PP
The configuration file defines all the stuff about what and how the
snapshots of subvolumes are taked.
Read more about it in snapman(5).
.SS Example file:
.IP
.EX
# subvolume    pool               frequency    quota

/              /backup/root/boot  0            30
/              /backup/root/diary 1d           30
/home          /backup/home/30m   30m          20
.EE
.PP
In every execution loop, if more time than indicated by the
\f[I]frequency\f[R] has passed, a new snapshot of the
\f[I]subvolume\f[R] will be created inside of its own \f[I]pool\f[R],
until reach the \f[I]quota\f[R], and then, when quota were overpassed,
it will deletes the oldest snapshot until fit to the quota.
.SH INCLUDED TOOLS
.SS sskd
Is the daemon.
Loads \f[CR]/etc/sstab\f[R] into memory and starts an infinite loop
where firstly runs \f[CR]ssmk\f[R] and then \f[CR]sscl\f[R] for each
line of such file.
.PP
By default the loop repeats itself every 5 seconds, but it can be
changed setting a \f[I]period\f[R] in command line.
.IP
.EX
Usage:
        sskd [\-h] [\-v] [period]

Options:
        period       Time in seconds for loop repeat. Defaults to 5.

        \-h           Show this help and exit.
        \-v           Show program version and exit.
.EE
.SS ssmk
Takes a source soubvolume and creates a snapshot and a destination
directory (called pool), where previous snapshots were stored.
.PP
Checks if the last snapshot in such pool is enough old and if there are
differences with source subvolume, and then takes a new snapshot.
.PP
The snapshot name is automatically set in the \f[CR]date\f[R] format
\f[B]\f[CB]+%Y\-%m\-%d_%H\-%M\-%S\f[B]\f[R].
.IP
.EX
Usage:
        ssmk [\-h] [\-v] \-p dir \-q quota \-f freq

Options:
        \-i subv      Set the subvolume.
        \-o dir       Set the output directory.
        \-f freq      Set the frequency.

        \-h           Show this help and exit.
        \-v           Show program version and exit.
.EE
.SS sscl
Takes a pool directory and checks if there are more snapshots than
indicated as maximum by the quota.
If then, deletes the oldest snapshots until the quota is met.
.IP
.EX
Usage:
        sscl [\-h] [\-v] \-p dir \-q quota

Options:
        \-p dir       Set the output directory.
        \-q quota     Set the quota.

        \-h           Show this help and exit.
        \-v           Show program version and exit.
.EE
.SS ssct
Shows when subvolume was created and when an inode in the subvolume was
last change.
.IP
.EX
Usage:
        ssct [\-h] [\-v] path

Options:
        path         Path to subvolume.

        \-h           Show this help and exit.
        \-v           Show program version and exit.
